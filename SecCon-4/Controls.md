The controls enforced in SECCON 4 implement more controls and a more sophisticated security
configuration than SECCON 5. While they may have a slightly higher impact to
users or to applications, they enforce a level of security more commensurate
with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information. Microsoft
recommends using the Audit/Enforce methodology for controls with an Audit mode,
and the rings methodology for those that do not, with a moderate timeline that
is anticipated to be slightly longer than the process in SECCON 5.

It consists of several mitigations that can be applied at either the operating system level, or at the individual app level. There is a risk to application compatibility, as some applications may rely on blocked behavior (e.g. dynamically generating code without marking memory as executable). Microsoft recommends gradually deploying this configuration using the Rings methodology.        |                  |

There is a risk to application compatibility, as some applications may rely on blocked behavior (e.g. an Office application spawning a child process). Each control has an Audit mode, and as such, Microsoft recommends the Audit / Enforce Methodology (repeated here):<br>1) Audit – enable the controls in audit mode, and gather audit data in a centralized location<br>2) Review – review the audit data to assess potential impact (both positive and negative) and configure any exemptions from the security control you need to configure<br>3) Enforce – Deploy the configuration of any exemptions and convert the control to enforce mode |

It expands the scope of Windows Defender SmartScreen to block all outbound HTTP(s) traffic that attempts to connect to low-reputation sources (based on the domain or hostname). There is a risk to application compatibility, as a result of false positives in flagged sites. Microsoft recommends deploying using the Audit / Enforce Methodology. |
