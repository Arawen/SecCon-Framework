Introducing the SECCON Framework
================================

Security configuration is complex. With thousands of group policies available in
Windows, choosing the “best” setting is difficult. It’s not always obvious which
permutations of policies are required to implement a complete scenario, and
there are often unintended consequences of some security lockdowns.

Because of this, with each release of Windows, Microsoft publishes [Windows
Security
Baselines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-baselines),
an industry-standard configuration that is broadly known and well-tested.
However, many organizations have discovered that this baseline sets a very high
bar. While appropriate for organizations with very high security needs such as
those persistently targeted by Advanced Persistent Threats, some organizations
have found that the cost of navigating the potential compatibility impact of
this configuration is prohibitively expensive given their risk appetite. They
can’t justify the investment in that very high level of security with an ROI. As
such, Microsoft is introducing a new taxonomy for Security Configurations for
Windows 10: The SECCON Baselines.

The SECCON Baselines organizes devices into one of 5 distinct security
configurations:

| SECCON 5             | SECCON 4                | SECCON 3                         |   | SECCON 2                          | SECCON 1                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Enterprise Security  | Enterprise              | Enterprise Cutting-Edge Security |   | Server and Service Administration | Identity and Security Administration |
|                      | High Security           |                                  |   |                                   |                                      |
| Productivity Devices |                         | Privileged Access Workstations   |   |                                   |                                      |

The SECCON Baselines divide configuration into Productivity Devices and
Privileged Access Workstations. This document will focus on Productivity Devices
(SECCON 5, 4, and 3). Microsoft’s current guidance on Privileged Access
Workstations can be found at <http://aka.ms/cyberpaw> and as part of the
Securing Privileged Access roadmap found at <http://aka.ms/privsec>.

Microsoft recommends reviewing and categorizing your devices, and then
configuring them using the prescriptive guidance for that SECCON level. SECCON 5
should be considered the minimum baseline for an enterprise device, and
increasing the protection based on both threat environment and risk appetite.

Security Control Classification
-------------------------------

This document groups recommendations into 3 categories:

| Policies                                                                                                                                                   | Controls                                                                                                                                                       | Behaviors                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft recommends enforcing the configuration of the specified policies in the manner described, to harden Windows to the designated level of security. | Microsoft recommends enabling the security controls specified in the manner described, to provide protections appropriate to the designated level of security. | Microsoft recommends changing organizational behavior towards the endpoint in the manner described. |

Security Control Deployment Methodologies
-----------------------------------------

The way Microsoft recommends implementing these controls depends on the
auditability of the control– there are two primary methodologies:

| Rings                                                                                                               | Audit / Enforce                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security controls which don’t support an audit mode should be deployed gradually. A typical deployment methodology: | Security controls which support an audit mode can be deployed using the following methodology: |

1.  Test ring – deploy to a lab to validate “must test” apps prior to any
    enforcement of configuration

2.  Pilot ring – deploy to a representative sample of 2 – 5% of the environment

3.  Fast ring – deploy to the next 25% of the organization

4.  Slow ring – deploy to the remainder of the organization

5.  Audit – enable the control in audit mode, and gather audit data in a
    centralized location

6.  Review – review the audit data to assess potential impact (both positive and
    negative) and configure any exemptions from the security control you need to
    configure

7.  Enforce – Deploy the configuration of any exemptions and convert the control
    to enforce mode

SECCON 5
========

| SECCON 5            |
|---------------------|
| Enterprise Security |

SECCON 5 should be considered the minimum baseline for enterprise devices, an
enterprise security configuration appropriate for any device that doesn’t access
sensitive data or systems.

Microsoft recommends the following configuration for SECCON 5 devices:

Policies
--------

The policies enforced in SECCON 5 are specifically chosen to be reasonably
non-impactful to users or to applications, while enforcing a reasonable level of
security. Microsoft recommends using the Rings methodology for these security
configurations and controls, noting that the timeline can generally be short
given the limited potential impact of the security controls.

| Windows Defender ATP EDR          | Deployed to all devices             | The Windows Defender ATP endpoint detection and response capabilities provides near real-time actionable advance attacks detections, enables security analysts to effectively prioritize alerts, unfold the full scope of a breach and take response actions to remediate the threat. When a threat is detected, alerts are be created in the system for an analyst to investigate. Alerts with the same attack techniques or attributed to the same attacker are aggregated into an entity called incident. Aggregating alerts in this manner makes it easy for analysts to collectively investigate and respond to threats. Windows Defender ATP EDR is expected to have no impact to users or applications, and therefore can be deployed in a single step to all devices.                                                                                                     |
| Windows Defender                  | Enabled for all compatible hardware | Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as applications will break if they require:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

While you may still need to leverage IE11 for compatibility with some sites, Microsoft recommends configuring Microsoft Edge as the default browser, and building an Enterprise Mode Site List to redirect to IE11 only for those sites that require it. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Enterprise Mode Site List, and then gradually deploying this configuration using the Rings methodology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Windows Defender                  | Enabled on compatible hardware      | Windows Defender Application Guard uses a hardware isolation approach. If an employee goes to an untrusted site through either Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge opens the site in an isolated Hyper-V-enabled container, which is separate from the host operating system. This container isolation means that if the untrusted site turns out to be malicious, the host PC is protected, and the attacker can't get to your enterprise data. There is a small risk to application compatibility, as some applications may require interaction with the host PC but may not yet be on the list of trusted web sites for Application Guard. Microsoft recommends leveraging either Windows Analytics or Enterprise Site Discovery to build the initial Network Isolation Settings, and then gradually deploying this configuration using the Rings methodology. |

Behaviors
---------

The behaviors recommended in SECCON 5 are specifically chosen to minimize impact
to users, applications, and the IT organization, while enforcing a reasonable
level of security.

| OS Security Updates | Deploy Windows Quality Updates within 7 days of release | As the time between release of a patch and an exploit based on the reverse engineering of that patch continues to shrink, engineering a process that provides the ability to validate and deploy quality updates addressing known security vulnerabilities is a critical aspect of security hygiene. |

SECCON 4
========

| SECCON 4                 |
|--------------------------|
| Enterprise High security |

SECCON 4 is the security configuration recommended as a standard for devices
where users access more sensitive information. These devices are a natural
target in enterprises today. While targeting high levels of security, these
recommendations do not assume a large staff of highly skilled security
practitioners, and therefore should be accessible to most Enterprise
organizations.

A SECCON 4 configuration should include all the configurations from SECCON 5 and
add the following security controls.

Policies
--------

The policies enforced in SECCON 4 implement more sophisticated security
configuration and controls. While they may have a slightly higher impact to
users or to applications, they enforce a level of security more commensurate
with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information. Microsoft
recommends using the Rings methodology for these security configurations and
controls, with a moderate timeline that is anticipated to be slightly longer
than the process in SECCON 5.

Controls
--------

The controls enforced in SECCON 4 implement a more sophisticated security
configuration and controls. While they may have a slightly higher impact to
users or to applications, they enforce a level of security more commensurate
with the risks facing users with access to sensitive information. Microsoft
recommends using the Audit/Enforce methodology for controls with an Audit mode,
and the Rings methodology for those that do not, with a moderate timeline that
is anticipated to be slightly longer than the process in SECCON 5.

1.  Audit – enable the controls in audit mode, and gather audit data in a
    centralized location

2.  Review – review the audit data to assess potential impact (both positive and
    negative) and configure any exemptions from the security control you need to
    configure

3.  Enforce – Deploy the configuration of any exemptions and convert the control
    to enforce mode

Behaviors
---------

The behaviors recommended in SECCON 4 implement a more sophisticated security
process. While they may require a more sophisticated organization, they enforce

| SECCON 3                         |
|----------------------------------|
| Enterprise Cutting-Edge Security |

SECCON 3 is the security configuration recommended as a standard for
organizations with large and sophisticated security organizations. Such
organizations are typically targeted by well-funded and sophisticated
adversaries, and as such merit the additional constraints and controls described
here.

A SECCON 4 configuration should include all the configurations from SECCON 5 and
SECCON 4 and add the following security controls.

Policies
--------

The policies enforced in SECCON 3 implement strict security configuration and
controls. They can have a potentially significant impact to users or to
applications, enforcing a level of security commensurate with the risks facing
targeted organizations. Microsoft recommends disciplined testing and deployment
using the Rings methodology.

| Security Options | Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings | Enabled                               | Windows Vista and later versions of Windows allow audit policy to be managed in a more precise way using audit policy subcategories. Setting audit policy at the category level will override the new subcategory audit policy feature. Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing group policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded to Windows Vista or later versions. To allow audit policy to be managed using subcategories without requiring a change to Group Policy, there is a new registry value in Windows Vista and later versions, SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy, which prevents the application of category-level audit policy from Group Policy and from the Local Security Policy administrative tool.            |

If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing users who are not administrators to read shared objects but not allowing these users to modify shared objects that they did not create.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If you enable this policy setting indexing will attempt to decrypt and index the content (access restrictions will still apply). If you disable this policy setting the search service components (including non-Microsoft components) are expected not to index encrypted items or encrypted stores. This policy setting is not configured by default. If you do not configure this policy setting the local setting configured through Control Panel will be used. By default, the Control Panel setting is set to not index encrypted content. When this setting is enabled or disabled the index is rebuilt completely. Full volume encryption (such as BitLocker Drive Encryption or a non-Microsoft solution) must be used for the location of the index to maintain security for encrypted files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Controls
--------

The controls enforced in SECCON 3 implement complex security configuration and
controls. They are likely to have a higher impact to users or to applications,
enforcing a level of security commensurate with the risks facing the most
targeted organizations. Microsoft recommends using the Audit/Enforce methodology
for controls with an Audit mode, and the Rings methodology for those that do
not.

Specifically, application control moves away from the traditional application trust model where all applications are assumed trustworthy by default to one where applications must earn trust in order to run. Application Control can help mitigate these types of security threats by restricting the applications that users can run and the code that runs in the System Core (kernel). WDAC policies also block unsigned scripts and MSIs, and Windows PowerShell runs in Constrained Language Mode. |

The behaviors recommended in SECCON 3 represent the most sophisticated security
configuration. Removing admin rights can be difficult, but it is essential to
achieve a level of security commensurate with the risks facing the most targeted
organizations.

| Remove Admin Rights | Remove as many users as possible from the local Administrators group, targeting 0. Microsoft recommends removing admin rights role by role. Some rules are more challenging, including: | Running as non-admin limits your exposure. When you are an admin, every program you run has unlimited access to your computer. If malicious code finds its way to one of those programs, it also gains unlimited access. When an exploit runs with admin privileges, its ability to compromise your system is much greater, its ability to do so without detection is much greater, and its ability to attack others on your network is greater than it would be with only User privileges. If you’re running as admin, an exploit can: |

-   Developers, who often install rapidly iterating software which is difficult
    to package for distribution through current software distribution systems

-   Scientists / Doctors, who often must install and operate specialized
    hardware devices

-   Remote locations with slow web links, where administration is delegated

It is typically easier to address these roles later in the process.

Microsoft recommends identifying the dependencies on admin rights and
systematically addressing them:

-   Legitimate use of admin rights: crowdsourced admin, where a new process is
    needed to complete that workflow

-   Illegitimate use of admin rights: app compat dependency, where app
    remediation is the best path. The [Desktop App
    Assure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/What-is-Desktop-App-Assure/ba-p/270232)
    program can assist with these app issues

-   install kernel-mode rootkits and/or keyloggers

-   install and start services

-   install ActiveX controls, including IE and shell add-ins

-   access data belonging to other users

-   cause code to run whenever anybody else logs on (including capturing
    passwords entered into the Ctrl-Alt-Del logon dialog)

-   replace OS and other program files with trojan horses

-   disable/uninstall anti-virus

-   cover its tracks in the event log

-   render your machine unbootable
